                                    It's a god-awful small affair
                        To the girl with the mousy hair
                        But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
                        And her daddy has told her to go
                        But her friend is nowhere to be seen
                        Now she walks through her sunken dream
                        To the seat with the clearest view
                        And she's hooked to the silver screen
                        But the film is a saddening bore
                        For she's lived it ten times or more
                        She could spit in the eyes of fools
                        As they ask her to focus on
                        Sailors fighting in the dance hall
                        Oh man!
                        Look at those cavemen go
                        It's the freakiest show
                        Take a look at the Lawman
                        Beating up the wrong guy
                        Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
                        He's in the best selling show
                        Is there life on Mars?
    
                        It's on America's tortured brow
                        That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
                        Now the workers have struck for fame
                        'Cause Lennon's on sale again
                        See the mice in their million hordes
                        From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
                        Rule Britannia is out of bounds
                        To my mother, my dog, and clowns
    
                        But the film is a saddening bore
                        'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
                        It's about to be writ again
                        As I ask you to focus on
    
                        Sailors fighting in the dance hall
                        Oh man!
