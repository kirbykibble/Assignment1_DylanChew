                                It's a god-awful small affair
                    To the girl with the mousy hair
                    But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
                    And her daddy has told her to go
                    But her friend is nowhere to be seen
                    Now she walks through her sunken dream
                    To the seat with the clearest view
                    And she's hooked to the silver screen
                    But the film is a saddening bore
                    For she's lived it ten times or more
                    She could spit in the eyes of fools
                    As they ask her to focus on
                    Sailors fighting in the dance hall
                    Oh man!
                    Look at those cavemen go
                    It's the freakiest show
                    Take a look at the Lawman
                    Beating up the wrong guy
                    Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
                    He's in the best selling show
                    Is there life on Mars?

                    It's on America's tortured brow
                    That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
                    Now the workers have struck for fame
                    'Cause Lennon's on sale again
                    See the mice in their million hordes
                    From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
                    Rule Britannia is out of bounds
                    To my mother, my dog, and clowns

                    But the film is a saddening bore
                    'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
                    It's about to be writ again
                    As I ask you to focus on

                    Sailors fighting in the dance hall
                    Oh man!
                    Look at those cavemen go
                    It's the freakiest show
                    Take a look at the Lawman
                    Beating up the wrong guy
                    Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
                    He's in the best selling show
                    Is there life on Mars?
